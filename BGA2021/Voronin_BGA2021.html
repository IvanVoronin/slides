# Background

.pull-left.smaller[
ADHD = inattention + hyperactivity

Twin heritability 70-80%

Largest GWAS: [Demontis et al. (2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0269-7)&lt;br&gt;
55,374 children and adults

Polygenic prediction ~3.6-4% in meta-analysis, mostly under 21yo [(Li &amp; He, 2021)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10802-021-00774-4)

Genetic architecture partially overlaps with educational attainment [(de Zeeuw et al., 2020)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10519-020-09992-w)

Intergenerational transmission: children of parents with ADHD present more severe ADHD symptoms [(Agha et al., 2013)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00787-013-0378-x)

*Research questions:*
1. *ADHD:* How well does child's genetic risk for ADHD predict ADHD symptoms across the childhood?
2. *Educational attainment:* How well does childs' genetic liability for education predict ADHD symptoms?
3. *Genetic nurture:* how well does parents' genetic risk predict early symptoms of ADHD
over and above child's own genetic risk?

Attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD, is a neurodevelopmental condition that typically starts in childhood and persists through the lifespan. Hyperactivity and inattention are two widely recognized dimensions of ADHD. 

The symptoms of ADHD are highly heritable and polygenic. In a meta-analysis, the polygenic score for ADHD explained up to 4% of the variance in the ADHD symptoms. The genetic architecture of ADHD partly overlaps with educational attainment.

Children of parents with ADHD tend to present more severe ADHD symptoms. However, its mechanisms of genetic transmission has not been well researched. It is possible that parental genetic risk contributes to child's symptoms through parental behaviors, the effect known as genetic nurture.

Our study has three main goals. First, we evaluate how well the polygenic score for ADHD predicts hyperactivity and inattention that were thoroughly assessed in childhood. Second, we compare the predictive power of the ADHD polygenic score with the polygenic score for education. Finally, we explore whether parents' genetic liability contributes to child's ADHD symptoms over and above child's own genetic risk.

# Sample and measures

.pull-left[
317 families from Quebec&lt;br&gt;(Quebec Newborn Twin Study)&lt;br&gt;
317 twins (one twin for each pair) + 394 parents

Polygenic scores:
- ADHD [(Demontis et al., 2019)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0269-7) 
- Educational attainment (EA)&lt;br&gt;[(Lee et al. 2018)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-018-0147-3)

Polygenic scores adjusted for 10 PCs
]

.pull-right[
Hyperactivity and inattention:
- *Early childhood*&lt;br&gt;reported by a parent 4 times&lt;br&gt; age 1.5-5 years
- *Primary school*&lt;br&gt;reported by a teacher 5 times&lt;br&gt;age 6-12 years
]

???

The sample of the study included participants from 317 families from Quebec Newborn Twin Study. One twin was selected from each twin pair for this analysis. The parental genotype data were incomplete, with only 394 parents provided their biosamples for genotyping.

To capture the genetic risk and liability we used child's and parents' genotypes to derive the polygenic scores for ADHD and education. The scores were adjusted for ten principal components of the genetic relatedness matrix to account for the population structure.

Child's hyperactivity and inattention were reported multiple times by parents and teachers. The parents reported the ADHD symptoms in early childhood. The teachers reported the symptoms in kindergarten and primary school after the age of 6.

# Analysis

.left-wide[
&lt;img src="tex/prediction_model.svg" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

.footnote[Similar model in [Pingault et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.02.16.21251737)]]

.right-narrow[
*PRS* = polygenic score&lt;br&gt;(ADHD PRS or EA PRS)

*PRS(ch)* = child's PRS

*PRS(m)* = mother's PRS

*PRS(f)* = father's PRS

*ADHD* = ADHD symptoms (hyperactivity or inattention)

FIML estimation to account for missing data

To address the research questions, we compared two models of polygenic prediction. The first model, on the left, included only child's polygenic score as a predictor of child's ADHD. The second model, on the right, included both child's and parents' polygenic scores as predictors. It was assumed that parents' genetic risk can predict child's ADHD bypassing child's own genotype.

The models were compared based on how much of the variance of the symptom they explained.

# Results

&lt;img src="pics/r2s.svg" width="90%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

???

This plot summarizes the results of the study. It shows how much of the variance of hyperactivity and inattention was explained by the polygenic scores.

Overall, the polygenic score for ADHD explained under 1% of the variance of both hyperactivity and inattention. The polygenic score for education achieved higher prediction, up to 6%. The best prediction was achieved for inattention in primary school.

The plot shows that the model that includes both child's and parent's polygenic scores explains more variance than the model with only child's predictor, but the difference between these two models is under 1%.

# Conclusions

.pull-left[
1. Polygenic risk for ADHD is a weak predictor of ADHD symptoms, `\(R^2 &lt; 1\%\)`

2. Polygenic risk for education is a stronger predictor of ADHD symptoms in primary school, `\(3\% &lt; R^2 &lt; 6\%\)`

3. No firm evidence for indirect genetic transmission of ADHD symptoms

.pull-right[
*Further directions:*
- Extending the genotype data
- Extending the phenotype: developm. trajectories of ADHD
- Incorporating both twins in the same model
- Mendelian imputation of missing genotypes [(Kong et al., 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.02.185181)
]

???

To conclude, the polygenic score for ADHD provides weak prediction of the ADHD symptoms in the sample of children from Quebec, with explained variance under 1%.

The polygenic score for education provides better prediction, explaining between 3 and 6%.

In general, including parental polygenic scores improves prediction, but the difference between two models is small, under 1%. Therefore, the data do not provide the evidence for the genetic nurture of ADHD.

The main weakness of our study is the lack of the power to detect the subtle effects of polygenic scores. We plan to address this issue by including more genotype data in the analysis, by using alternative phenotypes, such as developmental trajectories of hyperactivity and inattention, and by incorporating the data from both twins in the same model. We also want improve the statistical power by filling in the missing parental genotypes using Mendelian imputation approach.
